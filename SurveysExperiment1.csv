ics99vz6,ui73b4cc,19,Male,0,England,Chicago,"I think everyone adapted their reposne to isolating depending on the number of people infected. If only one person was infected then, everyone was more likely to go outside, whereas 4+ infected, less likely",I thought the experiment was very well setup. It was easy to figure out what was going on what what suitable response for the infection rate.
ca56z2zv,ui73b4cc,29,Female,0,England,Chicago,There was probably always at least one person who wasn't isolating.,A bit slow and maybe a bit buggy? On two occasions it said I didn't answer when I was already on the waiting for others page. Also the timer can be a bit too quick. Otherwise interesting study!

wfpzt5z0,ui73b4cc,36,Female,0,England,Chicago,I think they played based on the expense incurred by lockdown. At 90 points it was riskier to not self isolate. I think they probably also took note of the average isolation percentage each round to see how other players were behaving.,I though it was interesting. I was very aware of the greater expense when the cost of lockdowns increased and the resulting impetus to isolate to avoid going into lockdown. I think the setup also illustrated the importance of co-operation in self isolating to avoid lockdowns in general.
nwr8ut6o,ui73b4cc,,,,,,I think they played it tactically to try get as much points as possible. If we were close to lockdown they didn't isolate in order to get one last big points.,I thought the experimental setup was very simple but very effective. It was easy and fun to complete and kept me interested.
wv2ypvol,ui73b4cc,36,Male,0,England,Chicago,"I think they played it similar to me, trying to maximise their bonus while avoiding too many lockdowns.",It is a fun and interesting way to approach peoples attitudes to lockdowns and restrictions.

ri3991uw,ui73b4cc,35,Female,0,England,Tokyo,I think the group were very cautious.,I thought it was ok.
7fuuovrt,ui73b4cc,39,Female,0,Northern Ireland,Chicago,I think it is difficult to judge as Iâ€™m not sure how seriously they took it and compared it to our current situation,"Good and clear, I think it was clearly explained what the situation was and I hope i reacted appropriately"
mhnrlki6,ui73b4cc,33,Female,0,England,Chicago,I think the other group members played the game reasonably considering the odds,"It felt a bit repetetive and slow, especially towards the end"
tlrbw2wd,kiy32p78,21,Male,0,England,Chicago,Some of them must be not isolating at all and ruining the whole groups rewards,Very fun and well made
h95dma4u,kiy32p78,58,Female,0,England,Chicago,I think most of them would err on the side of caution,I think it was interesting
sisuspnh,kiy32p78,64,Male,0,Wales,Chicago,Quite honestly but testing different answers,Very interesting and made quicker by the timer. I enjoyed it and found it very interesting
ifhfugeh,kiy32p78,21,Female,0,Wales,Chicago,"I think we were isolating a bit too often, the other players might have been avoiding staying at home.","I think it was fun, very interesting to think about my own choices (and change them a few times during the experiment) and see how other people were coping."
19navfft,kiy32p78,47,Female,0,Wales,Tokyo,i was unsure of the other players commitment to the game,it was not easy to understand initially.  lots of information to remember
sq9bkwdu,kiy32p78,34,Female,0,Wales,Chicago,i think some werent looking at the figures before making isolation decisions,very repetavtive but interesting
mloknwd8,kiy32p78,32,Male,0,England,Chicago,Terrible,"Terrible, it did not provide clear instructions or situational awareness for individuals to correct themselves. Could have provided suggestion as what percentage or level of lockdown would be appropreate according to the number of infected people etc. The time to read and analyze the data was really short. I didn't see the effect/impact of the lockdowns and points getting deducted from my total point!"
0yi258kw,kiy32p78,49,Female,0,Northern Ireland,Chicago,I believe most were not in favour of complete isolation. Rarely did the percentage isolation go above 45%.,This was interesting. I'm not sure if the game was based on concepts of risk or of Covid in particular.
1mxiuapc,kiy32p78,33,Female,0,England,Chicago,I think they played for themselves & not as a team.,I liked it.
yu5vdppa,kiy32p78,34,Female,0,England,Chicago,I think they have been a little irresponsible as we went in lockdown quite a few times!,"It was slightly to quick, so I would allow more time to reply to the questions"
csnm750f,kiy32p78,26,Female,0,England,Tokyo,I think everyone played honestly using their previous experiences durning the pandemic.,I think I could get some more time to properly think about my answers - because of the time limitation i was constantly stressing over not choosing anything at all and getting timed out.
83wbkm0x,hbnj3sqi,30,Female,1,England,Chicago,"I had fun playing this game...well, knowing it was a game. at times I have taken risks and I think others did the same, just to see what it results in",It was a fun way of understanding others decisions

rhueshx1,hbnj3sqi,53,Male,0,England,Chicago,"I think the majority of people went quite high on their isolation scores, as they wanted to protect the group. This is especially on the potentially higher infection rounds.","I think the instructions were not all that clear, no was the consequence of our actions. I felt like whatever we chose made no actual difference to whether lockdowns occurred."
rqw7f61b,hbnj3sqi,22,Male,0,England,Tokyo,the were very risky and they did not isolate much,the experiments setup was interesting as it gave a similar representation as to how people isolated in real life
9o2i1w7b,hbnj3sqi,20,Male,0,England,Chicago,I think that the other players cared the most about their self interests (getting points) above the welfare of the group overall.,"I thought that that it was fairly easy to understand, but i felt a bit rushed when it came to reading through the instructions/changes at times, although it helped streamline the experiment."
6k42f5uv,hbnj3sqi,24,Male,0,England,Chicago,Probably didn't act as though they would in real life given the same infection statistics.,"I found it interesting, especially when the penalty for lockdown was changed."
3ej41aon,hbnj3sqi,40,Male,0,England,Chicago,I thought they were fair,It was fine
bzufjjnj,hbnj3sqi,27,Female,0,England,Chicago,To me it shows how covid has spread in real life - the lack of isolation when its only one person infected really highlights how people are kind of selfish,It's definitely different from usual experiments. its a welcomed change

wwwj081u,hbnj3sqi,24,Male,0,Wales,Chicago,I could not see their replies easily- at least not understand them well,I found the phrasing of the questions very confusing at first. I started to understand what you had meant about halfway through but it got very repetitive at the end
h8p6qlbd,hbnj3sqi,24,Female,0,England,Tokyo,i feel like they wasnt being as good as they should have been with sticking to the rules,it was very intersting
