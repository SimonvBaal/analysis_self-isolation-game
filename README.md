# Self-Isolation Game

This is the repository for the analysis of the Self-Isolation Game.

The analysis is done through first running the 'cleaning_self-isolation-game.Rmd' file, and then the 'analysis_self-isolation-game.Rmd' file.

Then, in the tables-and-figures folder, there is a 'tables-and-figures_self-isolation-game.Rmd' file, which can be run to reproduce the figures in the manuscript. Those figures are also contained in the folder.

The raw-data folder contains the raw data for the project, and the cleaned-data folder contains a file with the data that comes out after running the 'cleaning_self-isolation-game.Rmd', which can be used if skipping the cleaning phase is desired.

The R environment has been preserved in a lock file, such that it can be run in the future when the packages have been updated.
